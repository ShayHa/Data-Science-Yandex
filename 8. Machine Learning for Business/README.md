<p>
You work for the OilyGiant mining company. Your task is to find the best place for a new well.
Steps to choose the location:
Collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves;
Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells;
Pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values;
Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.
You have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.
